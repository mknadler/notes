Meteor uses five types of packages:

1. The Meteor core consists of different Meteor platform packages. These are included when you run 'meteor create'.
2. Regular Meteor packages are called 'isopacks', which is short for 'isomorphic packages'. This term means they work on both the client and the server. First-party isopacks include accounts-ui, appcache, etc., and are maintained by the Meteor core team and also come bundled with Meteor.
3. Third-party packages are isopacks developed by other users. They can be found on Atmosphere or via the 'meteor search' command.
4. Local packages are custom packages that you can create and add to the /packages directory.
5. NPM packages are Node.js packages; they don't work out of the box with Meteor, but can be used by the previous four types of packages.

Meteor loads & uses specific folder naming syntax:

/server directory code only runs on the server
/client directory code only runs on the client
Everything else runs on both server and client
Static assets go into /public

/lib files are loaded before anything else
main.* files are loaded after anything else
everything else loads in alphabetical order based on file name
