For back-end, SQL and PHP are common; however, Meteor uses MongoDB.
This is the only type of database available in Meteor.

SQL -> MongoDB terminology:
database	->	database
table		->	collection
row			-> 	document
column		->	field
primary key	->	primary key

Collections are used to store discrete *types* of data; if this were WordPress,
there'd be a collection for pages, and a collection for comments.

Creating a database:

collectionVar = new Mongo.Collection('collectionName');

---

collectionVar.insert({
	prop1: val1,
	prop2: val2
});
// Adds new document to collection, in JSON format

collectionVar.find();
// Retrieves all documents from collection (reactive)

collectionVar.find().fetch();
// Converts retrieved documents to array (non-reactive)

collectionVar.find().count();
// Returns number of documents in collection

---

In Meteor, there's no pre-defined structure for the database. 
Instead, the database structure is created on-the-fly.
